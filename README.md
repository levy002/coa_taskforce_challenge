## Photo Gallery

An interactive, responsive photo gallery application that allows users to navigate through thumbnails, view images in full size, and enjoy seamless browsing experience across desktop and mobile platforms.

## Coding Challenges
### String Transform
 - **Approach**
```
    - Determine String Length: Calculate the length of the input string to identify which transformation(s) need to be applied.

    - Reverse String (Divisible by 3): If the length is divisible by 3, I reversed the string using .split(), .reverse(), and .join() methods.

    - Convert to ASCII Codes (Divisible by 5): If the length is divisible by 5, I mappped each character to its ASCII code using .charCodeAt(0) and join these codes into one string.

    - Reverse and Change to Char code (Divisible by 5 and 3): In cases where the string length satisfies both conditions, I reversed the string and convert it's chars to ASCII Code.

    - Return Original String: For lengths not divisible by 3 or 5, return the original string unchanged. 
    
```


### Array Map
- **Approach**
```
    - Initializes currentSum, startIndex, and endIndex to get the subarray sum.

    - Iterates through given array and adding each element to currentSum if endIndex is less than less than the lenght of given array.

    - Increment startIndex if currentSum exceeds target and adjust the current sum to only have the sum of current subarray

    - Checks if currentSum matches target after each adjustment; returns true if a match is found.

    - Continues iterating and adjusting the subarray start and end as well as sum until there are not other possibilities or no match is found so I return false
